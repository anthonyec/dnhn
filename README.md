Quick and dirty remake of thenews.im to be faster and smaller

## Features
- **Fast** - No waiting for additional client-side loading
- **Small** - 96% smaller download size
- **Usable** - Lovely full no-ellipsis titles. And new items added since you last checked get a "New!" badge
- **Mobile** - Works better on mobile. Just scroll up and down, no swipping or hamburgers
- **Cheeky** - Uses thenews.im's very own API. Maybe that's bad. At least it's cached server side every hour
- **Comedy** - Code. Bad
