- **Fast.** No waiting for additional client-side loading.
- **Usable.** New links have "New!" badges. Visited links get deemphasized. And full titles that don't cut of.... 
- **Mobile.** No gestures or hamburgers, just scroll up and down.
- **Cheeky.** Uses thenews.im's very own API, cached every hour.

## Experimental features
- **Peak.** You can look at comments without leaving the page by pressing the **â¦¿** icon or pressing the [Space] key when hovering over an item.
- **Dark mode.** Everyone's doing it.

## How to Install
Bung the files on some hosting that supported PHP.
