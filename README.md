Quick and dirty remake of [thenews.im](http://thenews.im) to be faster and smaller.

- **Fast** - No waiting for additional client-side loading and the site is 96% smaller in download size.
- **Usable** - Full no-ellipsis titles. New items have "New!" badges. And visited links get grayed out.
- **Mobile** - Works better on mobile. Just scroll up and down, no swipping or hamburgers.
- **Cheeky** - Uses thenews.im's very own API. Maybe that's bad. At least it's cached server side every hour.

## Experimental features
- **Peak** - You can look at comments without leaving the page by pressing the **â¦¿** icon. It's like a worse version of macOS's Quick Look

## How to Install
Bung the files on some cheap shared hosting.
