- **Fast**
  + No waiting for additional client-side loading
  + 96% smaller in download size
- **Usable**
  + Full titles that don't cut of.... 
  + New links have "New!" badges 
  + Visited links are deemphasized
- **Mobile**
  + Just scroll up and down
  + No gestures or hamburgers
- **Cheeky**
  + Uses thenews.im's very own API
  + Maybe that's bad
  + Caches it every hour though

## Experimental features
- **Peak**
  + You can look at comments without leaving the page by pressing the **â¦¿** icon or pressing the [Space] key when hovering over an item. It's like a worse version of macOS's Quick Look

## How to Install
Bung the files on some cheap shared hosting.
